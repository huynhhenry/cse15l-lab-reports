Subject, Calculator Issue   
Hello, I am having trouble with my FibonacciCalculator. It is outputting 1 no matter what. Here is my code.    
I am not sure why this is happening, I have used a bash script to run the program.

Hey, (student) it is I, the TA here to help! 
It looks like the error you have is one due to logic with the calculateFibonacci method. Please recheck the logic on fibonacci calculations,    
here is a resource to look through.

Thank you, I have looked at it again and I had to replace the "*" with a "+". It now correctly outputs!

Your help has helped me do very well on this assignment. Thank you so much Henry!     
File and directory is /home/ because it was done in a new workspace on edstem.

The script and main method, was not changed.

The student changed the multiplication to addition and it no longer multiplied by 1 constantly and outputted the wrong thing.   
The vim practice was very useful on the second half of the quarter it has made me very profificent. I also appreciate the tips and tricks    
that my Ta's/tutors have taught me, like ways to access things and how to do things in windows compared to macos. I loved going to lab   
every week and learning new things.
