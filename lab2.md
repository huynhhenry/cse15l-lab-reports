The methods handleRequest and stringFormat were used.   
The relevant arguements for handleRequest is URI url which is the url that the server is on. On this server since it is a website, the url can change with a query. https://0-0-0-0-4000-ubn7ro3eha0k04di773cbblivk.us.edusercontent.com/add-message?s=Hello is the website in the picture. 
stringFormat takes an arrayList type and formats it to the the desiered output, being 
1. Hello
Which was decided by the url input.

"messages" inside the method has two values now because it is the second time it is called with a query.
stringFormat takes an arrayList type and formats it to the desired output, being
1. Hello
2. How are you
num now has the value 2, and stringFormat removes the +'s that comes from the %20 when you have spaces in the url and changes them with spaces to give us the desiered output. ArrayList messages has two elements as well now.

Before week 2 and week 3, I did not know how to open and start a server using the terminal. As well as what private/public keys are. I now also know how to access a remote computer using the ssh protocol which seems very useful. Everything in this course feels very practical.
